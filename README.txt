LMPredictor 1.0 contains 3 python scripts. LexiconExtract.py extracts words from the conversation textgrid files and outputs the mini lexicon, named 'lexicon'; LMdicParsor.py parses the phoneme transition - LM matrix as specified in "phn_trans_to_LM.txt"; LMPredictor.py reads textgrid files again and for each input file outputs a new textgrid file with four additional tiers - LM, glottalization, velopharyngeal, and the phonemes. The new files' names end with "_predicted". The original CMU pronouncing dictionary is also included.
